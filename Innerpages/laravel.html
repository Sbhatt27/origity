                With technology progression, more challenges are being
                introduced than ever before. Because of the fast changes in web
                development methodologies, companies must stay current and
                competitive. Web development is now a significant contribution
                to a company's competitive edge. It makes the company visible to
                the rest of the globe and aids in the generation of consumers

                Laravel is a PHP-based open-source framework that could be used
                to create creative, inventive, and high-performance online apps
                to satisfy specific business needs. Laravel accelerates the
                development process through simplification of repetitive
                activities and employs best practices to assist developers in
                working successfully and efficiently on the most difficult jobs.
                The MVC architectural pattern is used by the framework, which
                separates the data model containing the business logic from the
                user interface.
              </div>

              <div>
                The Laravel framework has built-in resources that help to
                streamline and improve the application's functioning. It offers
                well-organized, reusable, and manageable code that aids in the
                development of modular and responsive web applications.

                This is Laravel's built-in ORM implementation. Why is it known

                The first step in this procedure, when using PHPUnit, is to
                create new test classes, which are saved in the
                ./tests/directory associated with the Laravel application. This
                makes it extremely easy for PHPUnit to identify each test class.
                Other classes that do not live there will be disregarded.
