            <div>(Gain a Competitive Edge with our Angular Services)</div><br>
            <div>
              Angular is a top-recommended frontend framework having exquisite features and helps you to develop
              feature-rich UIs of your choice. Some of the astonishing features of Angular include lazy-loading,
              TypeScript support, Builder API support, Angular CLI update, Router with location, etc.
              <p>There are so many reasons why one should go with Angular. Some of the essentials are – </p>
            </div><br>
            <div>
              <strong class="text-warning">MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture – </strong>MVC is a trending
              development pattern that has seamless support for Swift and parallel workflow. Excellently supporting
              separation of concerns, it simply isolates the app logic from the UI layer. The model maintains data, View
              handles data display, and Controller manages the interactions of model and view.
            </div><br>
            <div>
              <strong class="text-warning">Two-way Data Binding – </strong>This is one of the pleasing features of
              Angular that excludes the need for DOM manipulation while project development. As the data model changes,
              the user interface of an app automatically updates.
            </div><br>
            <div>
              <strong class="text-warning">Reusable HTML components – </strong>Angular components are seamlessly built
              with HTML components that not only save a huge amount of time but finish app development faster. Not just
              that, it makes component testing much easier.
            </div><br>
            <div>
              <strong class="text-warning">Vast Community Support – </strong>Community is the main factor for any
              emerging technology. No matter how emerging technology is, if it has improper community support then it
              has no value. Angular is having magnificent community support to resolve the queries of developers
