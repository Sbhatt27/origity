                      Teachers have quick access to their students' attendance and academic records. This makes tracking a child's progress much easier for teachers. This helps teachers to communicate and interact with parents in a more efficient and productive manner. The more teachers know about their students, the better they can ensure that even the most vulnerable child is cared for.Â
