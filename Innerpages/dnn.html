              DNN is a simple feature-rich and open source content management system based on the Dot Net platform. The utilization of the three-tier model having an extraordinary modular structure makes it more pleasing for the users to adopt it. Nowadays people are more focused on client-side experiences rather than traditional DNN platforms which are highly focused on offering server-side functionality.
